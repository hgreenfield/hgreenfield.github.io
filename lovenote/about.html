      I have been interested lately in how love in the modern world is used or expressed often for a purpose other than love itself. Love is a force that drives economy as forcefully as it does personal relationships, and I’ve found that expressions of love on social media reflect this trend fairly accurately. On Twitter specifically, I found that searching for the keyword “love” turns up both sincere and insincere personal posts, as well as promotions for companies, events, public figures, ideas, etc. Twitter is not only a platform for individuals to express feelings for one another, but also for them to express feelings for objects and ideas and to hyperbolize, for companies to cultivate love for their products and services, and for politicians and other public figures to use love for their personal gains. I wondered how these messages might feel in a more personal context; will displaying both sincere and insincere expressions of love beside each other transgress the significance of the word? Will it be kinda funny? By placing different types of exchanges about love between a broad spectrum of entities inside individual "love letters," I hope to draw attention to what each user interprets the word "love" to mean. Each post involuntarily submits itself to the scrutiny of Love Note's readers, though Love Note creates no bias when collecting data. The simple purpose of this project is the draw attention to how the modular meaning of the word “love” contributes to the shaping of our realities.
      <br><br>
      Love Note uses Javascript to scrape Twitter's API for tweets including the words "I love," and displaying them inside "love notes" on its homepage, which may be refreshed to show new tweets. For now, the JSON data is logged inside the .js file as an array within a variable "data," which will change with the next API assignment. It turns out that it can be tricky to pull local files using javascript.

      <u>Other tools include:</u>
      <br><br>
      Moment.js // used to grab and format the date for the header.
      <br>
      Jquery // used to switch out classes containing letter images on mouseenter/ mouseleave.
      <br>
      Media queries // used to alter the format of the page based on the size of the browser.
